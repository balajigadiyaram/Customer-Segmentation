Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis for an Online Retailer

Project Description:

In this project, you'll work with a dataset from an online retail store that contains transaction data, including customer information, purchase history, and product details. The primary goals of the project are to perform customer segmentation and conduct market basket analysis to help the retailer better understand its customer base and improve sales strategies.

Steps to Complete the Project:

Data Acquisition:

Obtain the dataset, which should include customer information (e.g., name, address, email), transaction history (e.g., date of purchase, product ID, quantity, price), and product details (e.g., product name, category).
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Ensure data types are correct for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform summary statistics to get an overview of the data.
Visualize customer demographics, purchase patterns, and product categories using plots and graphs.
Customer Segmentation:

Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers based on their purchase behavior and demographics.
Explore different features for segmentation, such as recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM).
Market Basket Analysis:

Determine frequently co-purchased items by calculating association rules (e.g., Apriori algorithm).
Identify product affinities and recommend product bundles or cross-selling opportunities.
Customer Profiling:

Create customer profiles for each segment, describing their characteristics, preferences, and buying habits.
Visualization and Reporting:

Create visualizations and reports summarizing your findings and recommendations.
Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations.
Document your analysis process and results in a Jupyter Notebook or a report.
Recommendations:

Provide actionable recommendations to the retailer based on customer segments and market basket analysis.
How can they tailor marketing campaigns, product offerings, or pricing strategies for each customer segment?
Optional Extensions:

If time allows, you can build a simple dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to allow stakeholders to interact with the data.
Implement machine learning models for predicting customer behavior or sales forecasting.
